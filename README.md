# 3d-physics

Create a 3D physics engine using webGL to model orbitting bodies.

Should have the ability to model both lots of particles with no interaction and small numbersr of massive moving bodies interacting with eachother.

User should be able to experiment with the parameters of the model and move around in space to view their construction from differernt perspectives.
